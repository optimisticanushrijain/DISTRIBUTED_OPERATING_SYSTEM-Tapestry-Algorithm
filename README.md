# DISTRIBUTED_OPERATING_SYSTEM-Tapestry-Algorithm

GOAL: The goal of this project is to implement in Elixir using the actor model the Tapestry Algorithm and a simple object access service to prove its usefulness. We have developed a distributed application in this project that built an overlay network using Tapestry APIs with custom implementation for network join and requests routing. Through this, we demonstrated scalable, decentralized object location in peer-to-peer systems.

Language used: Elixir, Erlang, Atom
